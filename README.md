## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

This will install most of the packages you need.
Then cd into the frontend

### `cd frontend`

and install the rest of the packages required by installing node_modules again

### `npm i`

Run the front-end with this command:

### `npm start`

## Starting the Backend server

Make sure you have node.js installed, then cd back to the project directory (or start a new terminal)
